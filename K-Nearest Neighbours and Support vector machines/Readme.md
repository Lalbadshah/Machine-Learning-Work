#KNN and SVM

Here I tried to build a gender detection system based on images - The images are a subset of the LFW Face Database [http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/]
1) First make sure the male and female data folders are in the same directory as all the code
2) Run "PCA _Run_me_First.m" first it will perform the PCA and generate the file that contains the projected image vectors
3) Run "KNN_testing.m" This will provide varying accuracy cases for KNN function
4) Run "SVM_testing.m" This will provide varying accuracy cases for SVM

Important note - The accuracies are pretty awful here and the functions need to be tuned rigorously - However this is a good starting point?!

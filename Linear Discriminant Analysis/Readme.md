#Linear Discriminant Analysis - For facial recognition
Here I'm going to use the ORL database, available to anyone on
AT&Tâ€™s web site. This database contains photographs
showing the faces of 40 people. Each one of them was
photographed 10 times. These photos are stored as images
in levels of grey with 112x92 pixels. I have sub divided this data set for training and testing purposes

The images have the results that were observed from the testing
the main program is LDA.m run this to observe the accuracy results for the face recognition

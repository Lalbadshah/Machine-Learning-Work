#Principal Component Analysis based face recognition

Here I'm going to use the ORL database, available to anyone on
AT&Tâ€™s web site. This database contains photographs
showing the faces of 40 people. Each one of them was
photographed 10 times. These photos are stored as images
in levels of grey with 112x92 pixels. I have sub divided this data set for training and testing purposes

Here I perform PCA and test its ability to project and classify faces from the dataset with respect to varying number of Eigen Vectors used to project the datasets. the Eigen Vectors "Eigen Faces" are learnt from the training datasets
